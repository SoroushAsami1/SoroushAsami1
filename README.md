Hi!

 My name is Soroosh Esfahani, a product designer.

 In the past, I worked as a back-end developer and have experience in various fields such as web development, mobile development, and web-based software development. During this time, I learned how to design and develop practical and high-quality products.

 After that, I started working as a product designer and worked on various projects in the fields of learning, education, and educational technologies. During this time, I learned how to identify user needs and design products that are useful and practical for them.

 Currently, due to my great interest in artificial intelligence and its applications in product design, I am learning this field. I believe that artificial intelligence can play an important role in improving the user experience and creating more innovative products.

 I am always looking to learn new things and am eagerly awaiting new opportunities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
